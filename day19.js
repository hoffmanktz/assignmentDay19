/*

- Create an app that simulates the time-honored game "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock"

- Your game should allow the user to select a hand shape and play against the computer (which will select a random hand shape)

- The game should notify the user of the outcome, and should offer the user the option to play again

- The game should tell the user how they won or lost (e.g., display the message "Paper disproves Spock!")
